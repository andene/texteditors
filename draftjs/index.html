        <h2>Get started with Draft.js</h2>
        <p>This short get started guide will help you get started with Draft.js. The main objective will be that after this guide you will have an text editor in a React app, where you can open a template article.</p>

        <h3>Install create-react-app</h3>
        <p>
            For the sake of this tutorial we're going to use
            <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app"><code class="inline">create-react-app</code></a> app to
            create a
            React app.
            If you do not have that installed it can be installed with:
        </p>
        {% highlight bash %}
npm install -g create-react-app
        {% endhighlight %}

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Create the editor application</h3>

        <p>Start by creating a new React application using create-react-app</p>
        {% highlight bash %}
create-react-app blog-editor
cd blog-editor
        {% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            When the install script is completed your React app should be ready to run. Now we need to install Draft.js as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Install Draft.js</h3>
        <p>(React and React-dom is already installed in the previous step)</p>
        {% highlight javascript %}
npm install --save draft-js
        {% endhighlight %}
    </section>


    <section>
        <h3>Start the application</h3>
        <p>
            We can now try to run the React application. Type <code class="inline">npm start</code> in the CLI to start the development server

        </p>
        <p>
            When the dev server is started you should be able to open you React app
            by navigation to http://localhost:3000
        </p>
        <!--<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/draftjs/started.png" alt="React application template started"/>-->

    <section>
        <h3>Start developing</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's the time to open the source code to your project in one of your text editors.
            You will notice there are some folders and files already created for you by the create-react-app.

        </p>
        <p>
            In our case we will just go ahead and use the created components. Start by opening <code class="inline">./src/App.js</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The first step will</strong> be to remove some boilerplate code and replace it with the Draft.js Editor. I removed everything in div.App, I also changed the className property to blog-editor, after these changes my App.js looks like this.

        </p>
        {% highlight javascript %}

import React, {Component} from 'react'
class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="blog-editor"></div>
        )
    }
}
export default App
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>
            In the next step we will import <code class="inline">Editor and EditorState</code> from Draft.js, so at the top of the file we add
            the following import statement
        </p>

        {% highlight javascript %}
import { Editor, EditorState } from 'draft-js';
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>
            Then, in the render method, we add the <code class="inline">Editor</code> component and pass the
            editorState and onChange method as props.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that we are passing <code class="inline">this.state.editorState</code> and not just the imported EditorState.
            This means that our App.js has it's own state containing the editorState. The initials setup is done in the constructor.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also specify an <code  class="inline">onChange</code> method and passing as props.
            This method is triggered by Draft.js Editor and in our case it will just replace
            the old editorState with a new fresh one.
        </p>
        {% highlight javascript %}

import React, {Component} from 'react'
import { Editor, EditorState } from 'draft-js'
class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            editorState: EditorState.createEmpty()
        }

        this.onChange = (editorState) => {
            this.setState({
                editorState: editorState
            })
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="blog-editor">
                <Editor editorState={this.state.editorState} onChange={this.onChange}/>
            <div>
        )
    }
}
export default App

        {% endhighlight %}


        <p>
            If you haven't, start the dev server with <code class="inline">npm start</code>
            and open <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Congratulations</strong>, you now have an Draft.js editor up and running.
